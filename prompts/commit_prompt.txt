Given the text below write me a csv file that contains for each player, the name, pos, city, state, height, weight, stars, grade, and university:  

Instructions: Do not build code that does this. Just structure the text as you see it within the conditions layed out above. Ensure that the output is a single large string where each line represents a row in a CSV type format, and each value within a row is separated by a comma. 
IMPORTANT: IN THE EVENT THERE IS NO DATA FILL THE STRING WITH NONE VALUES FOR THE COLUMNS.

Think and use semantics when strucing the data. If for instance any value does not align with its column name adjust it to where it needs to be.

For example: Semantically speaking ; A pos is not a grade. A city is not a pos and height is not strcutred as weight. Ensure semantics hold
             when building the data.


WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE: SEMANTICS ARE EVERYTHING. A HIGHSCHOOL IS NOT A GRADE. CHECK EVERY COLUMN PRIOR TO SENDING BACK AND THEN SEND BACK WHAT should
                        BE RETURNED


           Name  Pos             City State  Height  Weight   Grade   
0  A.J. Morosco  ILB    Daytona Beach    FL   6'1''     225     70      
1     Nick Lind   RB  Highlands Ranch    CO  5'10''     205     62     


WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE: SEMANTICS ARE EVERYTHING. A UNIVERSITY IS NOT A GRADE. CHECK EVERY COLUMN PRIOR TO SENDING BACK AND THEN SEND BACK WHAT SHOULD 
                        BE RETURNED. DO NOT CONFUSE STARS AND GRADE!!!!!!!! ENSURE POS IS A FOOTBALL POSITION BECAUSE IT IS NOT A CITY, JUST AS A CITY IS NOT A STATE. 

               Name  Pos          City State  Height  Weight     Grade  
0   Jasper Williams  ILB       Suwanee    GA   6'1''   210.0      55                
1       Brett Skene   WR        Denver    CO   6'1''   190.0      78                
2   Stephen Shaffer   TE        Austin    TX   6'3''   235.0      NaN          
3     Phillip Ofili    S       Cypress    TX   6'1''   185.0      64                  
5   Brent McElfresh   WR  Stephenville    TX   6'1''   180.0      NaN                 
6    Ronnie Lillard  ILB  Lehigh Acres    FL   6'3''   200.0      69                 
7       Steve Jones   CB   Kansas City    MO   NaN     NaN        NaN                         
8        Chad Gross    K       Suwanee    GA   NaN     NaN        NaN                     
9      Irvin George   RB       Orlando    FL  5'11''   190.0      NaN                
10  P.J. Adeji-Paul    S         Tulsa    OK   6'0''   180.0      64                 
11         Jeff Abt   QB       Houston    TX   6'2''   190.0      75              




FINALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTURCTIONS IS THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE INFOMATION. BELOW IS THE PATTERN THAT EACH PLAYER WILL HAVE.
SOMETIMES NUMBERS WILL BE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY WHEN THINGS ARE THERE. FOR INSTANCE GRADES ARE ONLY NUMBERS 50 AND ABOVE OR THEY DONT EXIST. GRADES
ARE DOUBLE DIGIT NUMBERS SO YOU WILL NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT WHAT IS WHAT. UNIVERSITY MUST BE A COLLEGE NAME 

RULES TO NOT BREAK:

1. Below is the acceptable columns names. Each should have its respective semantically sound 

NAME POS CITY HT WT	GRADE	




Example of what should be returned:	

"Name,Pos,City,State,Height,Weight,Grade \nA.J. Morosco,ILB,Daytona Beach,FL,6'1'',225,70,Air Force  \nNick Lind,RB,Highlands Ranch,CO,5'10'',205,62,Air Force"
